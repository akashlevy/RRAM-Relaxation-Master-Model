# RRAM-Relaxation-Master-Model
Repository containing the data and the code for the RRAM relaxation master model

## Mathematica Model

See `model.nb`.

## Analysis on RRAM Relaxation Experimental Data

See `analysis.ipynb`. Make sure to join split files like `techB/tsdata.min.tsv.gz` first: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/24630/whats-the-best-way-to-join-files-again-after-splitting-them

## Raw Data

The three datasets (per technology) consist of (1) continuous time series data for spectral analysis (tsdata), (2) relaxation data for both short-term and long-term (relaxdata), and (3) baking data for temperature dependence (bake). For the full (not minimal) datasets visit:
